# Simon-Game
Simon Game using Vanilla JS ( works only on PCs, mobile version come soon )

Rules to play the game :

1-player Game


    1. Start the game by pressing a key on keyboard.Simon will give the first signal. Repeat the signal by pressing the same color button.

    2. Simon will further add one more signal. Repeat these two signals by pressing the same color buttons, in order.

    3. Continue playing as long as you can repeat each sequence of sig- nals correctly. After the 5th, 9th and 13th signals in a sequence, Simon automatically speeds up.

    If you fail to repeat a sequence exactly, Simon responds with a typical sound. This means you've lost, and the sequence of signals ends.
